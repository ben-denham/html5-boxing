HTML5 Boxing

I created this game in 2012 as an educational experiment to help me learn some of the techniques involved in creating simple games with HTML5.
There is a lot of room for improvement, as the code needs tidying up, and the sounds and images could probably be replaced.
For now I have just released it for others to enjoy and perhaps build upon, though I may continue working on it in the future.

To play this game straight from the files, simply open index.html in a modern browser.
The game is also playable online at: http://html5-boxing.herokuapp.com/
